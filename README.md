# Website sqlite3 connection with django
 css javascript bootstraping and sqlite3 connection with django 

### What this project has done for me
- It was a very good project to improve myself with Django and with sqlite3.
- It helped me improve myself a lot in Bootstrap, which uses CSS and Javascript in website design. I learned about desing website with extensions. I prefer this to blog style websites
- I learned to code concepts such as opening a membership to the site, logging in and logging out of the account.
- I learned to connect the website interface and database.
- With the help of database website connection, we can make changes on the website through the interface without making any changes to the main code.
- By using Jinja, I learned to use the same navbar, footer and links in all extensions of our website.
- Website design with discrete files, database website connection etc. It gave me a lot of skills.

# Follow the steps to run the project 
> #### If you wish, you can look at the visual explanation in the lower pane.

- ### 2- We need to download the necessary libraries. You can do this by typing the following commands in the terminal.
  - #### `pip install Django` and add extension `jinja` .

- ### 3- In the file directory we are in, we write `python manage.py runserver` to the terminal. When you copy and paste this address, which will give us the local host and port address, the website will appear.

- ### 4- Now you can surfing on my website. You can register , log in, log out , You can surfing on pages (ex. home, about, stories). You can click my links on footer.

- ### 5- You can login to the admin panel by creating an admin user. So what does this panel do? How do I create an admin user?
   - #### A-) In the file directory we are in, we write `python manage.py createsuperuser` to the terminal for create admin user. than register.
   - #### B-) In addition to the website address, we can reach our admin panel login page by typing /admin
